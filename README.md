### Setup

First ensure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) are installed, then run the following commands:

```
cd moba
```

You should now be ready to run the app. These next commands run continuously, and are ideally placed in two terminal tabs next to each other.
